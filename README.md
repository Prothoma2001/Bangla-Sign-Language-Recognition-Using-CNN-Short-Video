# Bangla-Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-CNN-Short-Video
 In this video, at first we show our datasets, BdSL_OPSA22_STATIC1 and BdSL_OPSA22_STATIC2, along with few images from the datasets. We have shown an example of training on one of our dataset, BdSL_OPSA22_STATIC2. Finally, we have shown 2 examples (17: খ\Kha and 22: জ\Jo), where the character in image is correctly classified. The video shows how we are training usng our algorithm and our own dataset, and the accuracy from our training. Moreover, the individual class accuracies, F1-score, precision, recall, sensitivity and specificity are also shown in the video after the training, where we can observe how the individual classes are performing.
